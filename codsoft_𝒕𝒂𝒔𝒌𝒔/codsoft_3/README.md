# Image Captioning Model

Image captioning involves creating a model that can analyze the content of an image and generate a human-like description. This model is built using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation.










## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of two main components:

● __Encoder (CNN)__: Extracts image features using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet50).

● __Decoder (RNN)__: Generates captions using a recurrent neural network, typically LSTM or GRU.
